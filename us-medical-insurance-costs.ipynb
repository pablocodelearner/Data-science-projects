    "This is a **Data Science Python** portfolio project. The data set is provided by *codecademy.com* (Codecademy from now on) and it cosists in a csv file called 'insurance.csv' containing data about a group of people of the U.S., and how much they've been charged in medical insurance costs (in dollars). Even though this project belongs to a skill path at Codecademy, it is presented as a great opportunity to craft a showcase of the student skills. In fact, it encorages the student to optionally go beyond what he/she has learnt in the skill path at the given point, and apply alternative concepts and tools that may be useful for the implementation of the analysis (i.e. using Python libraries such as _Numpy_, _Matplotlib_ or _Pandas_)."

   "source": [
    "* The individual who pays the lower medical insurance costs is a 18 years old male person, with a BMI of 23.2 (that is inside the healthy range), who has no children, does not smoke and lives in the southeast region.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "* The individual who pays the higher medical insurance costs is a 54 years old female person, with a BMI of 47.4 (in the obese range, closer to the highest BMI found value in the data set, which is 53.1), who has no children, does smoke and lives in the southeast region.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "* The people who are in the data set have ages from 18 to 64 years old. The age mean and median match: 39 years old. The maximum percentage of people are 18 years old, more than double the rest of the ages percentages, so this data is slightly skewed. Taking a look to the mean and median, even though it cannot be perceived a proportional connection between age and charges, some of the top charges are the ones that have a mean higher than 20000 in charges. These would be 60, 61 and 64 years old people. On the other hand, the median does increase with age almost directly proportional. When looking at the interquartile range for each age, the values are quite heterogeneous.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "* In the sex category, the total charged for men is greater than for female, but there are more men than woman in the sample (676 men against 662 women). The mean and median values are very similar, but the interquartile range is significantly higher for men, so between this group the charges they pay are more spread.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "* The first look at the BMI category was shocking. Over the half of the sample are people with obesity (52.84%). Only 16.59% of the sample falls in the healthy range. This alone is worrisome data. On the other hand, underweight people in the data set are only 1.49%. People with overwehgt sum almost 30%. There is a connection bewteen bmi category and charges, as underweight are who pay the less, followed by healthy, overweight and obese people. Their mean and median values confirm that. However, looking at the interquartile range it seems that there is more variation in what obese people get charged for medical insurance costs than the other groups, whose interquartile range is very similar. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "* The sample is very spread for people with a different number of children. There is people in the data set with zero to five children. More than half of the data (67.12%) are people with zero or one children, and people with four and five children suppose a tiny percentage of the sample (1.87% and 1.35% respectively). \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The higher mean of charges is for the people with three children, and the lower for those who have five. Median and interquartile ranges show significant differentes between the groups inside children. The higher difference of what they pay comes to the people with three children, and the lower for the people with five. There is no direct connection between number of children and insurance costs, probably that's because of the other categories in the data set. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "* What about smokers? We can conclude that being a smoker really raise insurance costs. The sample provided of smokers and non-smokers is very different (274 vs 1064). Despite that, the total charges for both are the same. Looking at the mean we begin to find the first differences between the two groups, as smokers pay a mean of 32050.23, and not-smokers pay only 8434.27. Huge difference! Also, the median charge values both groups are noticeably distant: for smokers is 34456.35 and for non-smokers is 7345.4. The interquartile range for non-smokers is very similar to their median, 7376.44, but in the smoker group this extends to 20192.96. This is really something to look through!\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "* Northwest and southwest inhabitants get charged similar insurance costs, and the samples from those areas in the data set are equal. On the other hand, the northeast sample is very similar to the aforementioned (only one less), but their insurance costs are greater, so this region is more expensive for medical insurance costs. There is another skewed data example here, as southeast people taken into consideration for this analysis are fourty more than people from the other regions. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "If we look at the mean, it seems that U.S. southeast inhabitants pay more for their insurance cost, followed by northeast, northwest and southwest people. This is skewed, because as it was mentioned before, the sample from southeast is significantly greater than from the other regions. In this category, the medians give as more accurate information. For southeast it is the second higher, surpassed by northeast, and followed by nothwest and southwest. Attending to the interquartile range, there is more difference in what southeast inhabitants get charged. The region were the costs are more similar is southwest."
